## _Here are the things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):_

### Blocks
  - A block is the same thing as a method, but it does not belong to an object. Blocks are called closures in other programming languages. 

```
["Geeks", "GFG", 55].each {|i| puts i}  
```
```
Geeks
GFG
55
```
