## _Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):_

### Creating Posts
1. To create a post, add a file to your `_posts` directory with the following format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
```
2. All blog post files must begin with front matter which is typically used to set a layout or other meta data. 

```

layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"

# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

I hope you like it!
```
3. Commit your changes
