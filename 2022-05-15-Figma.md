After hearing much about it I finally used Figma today. 

Figma is a web-based graphics editing and user interface design app. 
In theory, you can use it to do all kinds of graphic design work from wireframing websites, 
designing mobile app interfaces, prototyping designs, crafting social media posts, and everything in between.

One of my favorite features from it is that I can extract CSS styles directly by inspecting elements.
